## Welcome to Math Camp!

Typically Math Camp is a 5-day intensive review of algebra, matrix algebra, calculus and probability. In order to provide the same curriculum while avoiding an 8 hour Zoom call, this year we will be uploading lectures. Lectures are intended to be watched outside of synchronous class time. During our Zoom meetings, we will discuss certain topics from lectures, address questions, and work examples together and in small groups. Afternoon labs will be held in person where we will all work through examples together on Zoom in real time (i.e. there is no prep necessary for lab).

  **Instructor:** Jessica Godwin, Ph. D. Candidate, Dept. of Statistics  
  **TA:** Emily Finchum-Mason, Ph. D. Candidate, Dept. of Public Policy and Management  

## Schedule

The daily schedule may vary as we adapt to an online version of Math Camp, but the tentative synchronous learning schedule is as follows:  

  **10:00am-10:45am**  Review lectures and practice problems (First day, introduction)  
  **10:45am-11:30am**  Breakout Rooms: Practice problems  
  **1:30pm-3:00pm**    R labs  
  **3:00pm-4:00pm**    Additional problem session/office hours (if needed)  

Slides and materials will be linked to in the schedule below as they are made available.
